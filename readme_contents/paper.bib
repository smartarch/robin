This paper gives a broad view of the publications in {EAAI} from 1988–2018, which are indexed in Web of Science ({WoS}) and Scopus. The main purpose of this research is to bring forward the prime impelling factors that bring about the {EAAI} publications and its citation structure. The publication and citation structure of {EAAI} is analyzed, which includes the distribution of publication over the years, citations per year and a bird’s eye view of the citation structure. Then the co-citation analysis and over the year’s trend of top keywords is given. The co-authorship networks and a geographic analysis of the sources is also provided. Further, a country-wise temporal and quantitative analysis of the publications is given along with the highly cited documents among the {EAAI} publications.},

These features include citation management, online synchronization and collaboration, {PDF} management and annotation, and integration with word processing software. The article concludes with a discussion of how a social networking tool such as Mendeley might impact the academic scholarship process.},

Zotero offers more options for note taking than the better-known citation management system {EndNote}. Sixteen citation styles are available when Zotero is initially downloaded, with many more freely available. Users can install a plug-in that allows Zotero to integrate with Microsoft Word. Even though Zotero does not have an on-demand customer support service, its Web site offers a wealth of information for users. The authors highly recommend Zotero.},

	doi = {10.3389/frai.2021.685298},
	shorttitle = {Sysrev},
	abstract = {Well-curated datasets are essential to evidence based decision making and to the integration of artificial intelligence with human reasoning across disciplines. However, many sources of data remain siloed, unstructured, and/or unavailable for complementary and secondary research. Sysrev was developed to address these issues. First, Sysrev was built to aid in systematic evidence reviews ({SER}), where digital documents are evaluated according to a well defined process, and where Sysrev provides an easy to access, publicly available and free platform for collaborating in {SER} projects. Secondly, Sysrev addresses the issue of unstructured, siloed, and inaccessible data in the context of generalized data extraction, where human and machine learning algorithms are combined to extract insights and evidence for better decision making across disciplines. Sysrev uses {FAIR} - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - as primary principles in design. Sysrev was developed primarily because of an observed need to reduce redundancy, reduce inefficient use of human time and increase the impact of evidence based decision making. This publication is an introduction to Sysrev as a novel technology, with an overview of the features, motivations and use cases of the tool.
            
              Methods:
              Sysrev. com is a {FAIR} motivated web platform for data curation and {SER}. Sysrev allows users to create data curation projects called “sysrevs” wherein users upload documents, define review tasks, recruit reviewers, perform review tasks, and automate review tasks.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Sysrev is a web application designed to facilitate data curation and {SERs}. Thousands of publicly accessible Sysrev projects have been created, accommodating research in a wide variety of disciplines. Described use cases include data curation, managed reviews, and {SERs}.},

The method is data intensive and time consuming, and hence is usually supported by a wide range of software-based tools. However, systematic reviewers have found that finding and selecting tools can be quite challenging. In this paper, we present the Systematic Review Toolbox; a web-based catalogue of tools, to help reviewers find appropriate tools based on their particular needs.},
